Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

My name is Anmol Emmanuel Peters, but most people just call me Emmanuel. I am a 5th year Master's student. I was a math and philosophy major for my undergrad and decided to do my masters in Data Science following a year spent coding neural networks in a fin-tech company.
